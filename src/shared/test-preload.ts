// The whole `bun test` process shares ONE SQLite DB — the db module is a
// singleton opened (at import) against the OCD_DATA_DIR set above, and bun runs
// every test file in that single process. Historically the only isolation was
// convention: unique row names + hand-written cleanup, including FK-cascade
// footguns. That leaks. Rows a file forgets to delete stay visible to every
// later test, and because bun's file execution order differs between machines
// it fails nondeterministically — passing locally, failing on CI. The failures
// were exactly this: renderDynamicConfig reads every row so leaked state
// dropped a fixture from collectDesiredState, and a stale child row tripped a
// FOREIGN KEY sweep in the deploy op.
//
// Wiping every table before each test makes each test independent of whatever
// ran before it. Safe because no unit-test file seeds DB rows at import time
// nor relies on cross-test persistence — fixtures are created inside each test
// (or its own beforeEach, which registers deeper and so runs after this one).
//
// The exception is the integration suites, which DO provision real resources in
// `beforeAll` and read the resulting DB rows across tests within a file — a
// per-test wipe would delete that state out from under them. They only actually
// run (rather than describe.skip) when their gating env is present, so mirror
// that condition and skip the wipe exactly then. Under a normal `bun test`
// (CI included) the wipe is active.
