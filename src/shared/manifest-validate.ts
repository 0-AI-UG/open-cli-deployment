/**
 * Fail-fast, field-level schema validation for deploy (`.ocd-deploy.json`) and
 * stack (`ocd-stack.json`) manifests. Thin wrapper over the canonical Zod
 * schemas in `./manifest-schema.ts` (the single source of truth from which the
 * manifest TypeScript types are also derived) so the shape and the validator
 * can never drift.
 *
 * These validators THROW a single Error listing every issue found (file + field
 * path + expected-vs-got), so a bad manifest is rejected BEFORE the deploy
 * engine ever sees it.
 *
 * Wrong-typed and UNKNOWN keys are hard errors by default. Callers may opt into
 * `allowUnknown` only as an explicit forward-compatibility escape hatch.
