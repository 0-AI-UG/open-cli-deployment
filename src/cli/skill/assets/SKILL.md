# OCD Deploy

Use the `ocd` CLI for Open CLI Deployment panels. OCD owns provider-neutral HTTPS
Git checkout, BuildKit image creation, immutable OCI publication, manifest
reconciliation, and runtime rollout. GitHub signed push webhooks are an optional
trigger integration; GitHub Actions is not part of app delivery.

## Safety contract

- Inspect before mutating live resources.
- Use `ocd deploy --dry-run` before material configuration changes.
- Keep plaintext secrets out of manifests and logs. Use explicit environment references,
  `--auth-password-env`, and panel Settings.
- Every runtime rollout still uses `repository@sha256:<digest>`. Mutable build
  tags are temporary transport only and never become desired runtime state.
- Webhook delivery checks out the exact pushed commit and reconciles the
  committed manifest or stack. Do not substitute `ocd release` when manifest,
  runtime environment mapping, or stack configuration may have changed.
- Before panel upgrades, back up the database, verify current image digests,
  and ensure the release commit contains the features running in production.
- For persistent data, inspect the actual driver and mount; a local directory
  is not a separately billed provider disk or an enforced size reservation.
- Do not delete, purge, rollback, migrate, promote, or recover resources
  without explicit user intent.

## Core model

`.ocd-deploy.json` is complete desired state for one app. It declares exactly
one delivery source: a `build` object for OCD-owned Git/BuildKit delivery, or
an `image` reference for any prebuilt OCI image. Tags in `image` are resolved
to immutable digests before deployment. Credentials never belong in either.

For a `build` manifest, `ocd deploy` resolves the exact local Git commit, asks
a dedicated OCD build worker to clone that commit, pushes the result to
`build.image_repository`, records the registry digest, then reconciles the
complete manifest. A webhook-enabled build deploy creates a build source and
HMAC webhook secret.

For an `image` manifest, `ocd deploy` resolves the declared tag or digest and
reconciles the complete manifest without a source checkout, build worker, or
build source. Public images can be pulled anonymously; private images need a
matching registry connection.

A signed GitHub push webhook repeats that flow from the pushed SHA. For stacks,
OCD reads the committed stack and child manifests and deploys dependency levels.
This keeps runtime environment mappings and configuration synchronized with code.

`ocd release --image repository@sha256:digest` remains an advanced artifact-only
escape hatch. It changes the image while preserving stored configuration; it
does not read a manifest.

Private Git checkout and registry push/pull credentials are explicit scoped
connections, configured with `ocd source login` and `ocd registry login` or the
panel connection cards. Public repositories need no Git token. DNS remains
operator-owned; OCD only displays records. Hetzner remains optional
infrastructure.

## Typical workflow

```bash
ocd bootstrap
ocd login https://panel.example.com
ocd doctor
ocd manifest validate .ocd-deploy.json
ocd deploy --dry-run
ocd deploy
ocd app show my-app
```

For a `build` manifest, also connect its output registry, check build capacity,
and optionally configure the GitHub push webhook:

```bash
ocd registry login registry.example.com/team --username=registry-user
ocd doctor
ocd runners sources
ocd runners webhook-secret <source-id>
```

Configure the returned URL and one-time secret in GitHub as an
`application/json` webhook for push events. Later pushes build and deploy in
OCD without GitHub Actions minutes.
