# OCD Reference

An app manifest declares exactly one delivery source. OCD can build an exact
Git commit on a dedicated BuildKit worker and publish it to
`build.image_repository`, or deploy any compatible prebuilt OCI reference from
`image`. Either way, OCD resolves an immutable digest before runtime rollout.
GitHub push webhooks are an optional trigger for build-backed manifests and
require no GitHub Actions runner.
