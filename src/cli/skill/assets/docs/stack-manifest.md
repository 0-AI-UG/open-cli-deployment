# `ocd-stack.json` Stack Manifest

Use a stack for apps that share dependency ordering and environment wiring.
Each app entry references its own `.ocd-deploy.json`; each child manifest can
build from Git or select an OCI image.

Stack `blog`, app key `api` becomes `blog-api`; app key `database` becomes
`blog-database`.

## Complete field reference

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `$schema` | Optional schema version; currently `1`. |
| `$llm` | Optional tooling metadata ignored by the engine. |
| `name` | Required stack identifier and resource prefix. |
| `description` | Optional human metadata. |
| `release_order` | Optional integer ordering stacks within a repository release (default zero). |
| `environment` | Existing shared production environment name. |
| `staging_environment` | Optional existing shared staging environment name; `null` clears the link. It does not create an environment or app. |
| `apps` | Required non-empty app map. |

App entries support:

- `apps.<key>.manifest`: required child manifest path relative to the stack;
- `apps.<key>.needs`: app keys that must become healthy first;
- `apps.<key>.domain`: override the child domain;
- `apps.<key>.public`: override child public routing.

Unknown nested fields and unknown `needs` targets are rejected.

## Dependency and environment behavior

Each child's `env` map defines its complete user runtime environment. The
stack selects an existing environment once; child manifests inherit it unless
they explicitly select another environment or detach with `null`. Omitting
the stack environment clears its selection. Deployment never creates or
changes stored values.

A consumer can declare `"DATABASE_URL": {"from": "apps.database.outputs.URL"}`.
The database declares `"outputs": {"URL": {"template":
"postgresql://{env.DATABASE_USER}:{env.DATABASE_PASSWORD}@{app.host}:{app.port}/{env.DATABASE_NAME}",
"secret": true}}`. Templates read the producer's resolved runtime variables.
The output is delivered directly to the consumer; it is not a shared stored key.

References infer dependency ordering. Keep `needs` for dependencies that have
no variable reference. Missing members, missing output names, and cycles fail
preflight. Dependencies become healthy before consumers; independent members
can proceed concurrently. Secret metadata propagates through derived outputs.

Treat staging as a separate delivery target. `ocd deploy stack` reconciles the
declared production app members; it does not synthesize staging siblings.
Create staging apps separately with their own manifests, environment, and
domain, then release their exact digests explicitly. Promote between explicit
app names only after validation; see
[Releases, promotion, and rollback](releases-promotion-and-rollback.md).

## Reconciliation

`ocd deploy stack` submits complete desired membership:

- selected members are built from the exact repository commit or resolved from
  their prebuilt image reference;
- existing member configuration is reconciled;
- omitted recorded members are destroyed;
- dependency ordering and shared ingress are reconciled;
- newly created side effects are compensated on failure;
- environments are retained on member or stack destruction;
- managed volumes are detached and retained, never silently destroyed.

Review the diff before removing or renaming a key; a rename is remove-plus-
create. Repository push webhooks normally build and reconcile the complete
stack. Use `ocd release <fully-qualified-app-name> --image <digest>` only for
an intentional artifact-only rollout after configuration is synchronized.

## Example

```json
{
  "$schema": 1,
  "name": "blog",
  "environment": "production",
  "apps": {
    "database": {
      "manifest": "apps/database/.ocd-deploy.json"
    },
    "api": {
      "manifest": "services/api/.ocd-deploy.json",
      "needs": ["database"],
      "public": false
    },
    "web": {
      "manifest": "services/web/.ocd-deploy.json",
      "needs": ["api"]
    }
  }
}
```

`release_order` is an optional integer (default zero). Repository releases reconcile
stacks in ascending order so private dependencies can be ready before consumers in
another stack. Existing stack and app names remain stable. Unchanged immutable
images with matching configuration, environment and healthy attested replicas are
skipped even when the repository commit changes.
