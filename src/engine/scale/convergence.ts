 * replicas outside the deploy saga: the autoscaler and the manual scaling API
 * merely write `apps.desired_replicas` and let this loop make reality match.
 *
 * It records no scaling_event and rewrites neither desired_replicas nor
 * last_scale_at — the intent, and its trigger label, was already recorded by
 * whoever set desired_replicas. This function only performs the physical work.
 *
 * Reaching desired == 0 flows through scaleDown(…, 0), which stops containers,
 * keeps the sleeping anchor, installs the wake page and flips the app to
 * `sleeping` — so scale-to-zero is just the count-0 case, not a special path.
